# Install McStas 2.5 on Linux and Unix.

* We provide Debian packages, RedHat packages, and tar.gz's of "preconfigured" source code.

* **NOTE!!!** The preferred way of installing on Debian/Ubuntu or CentOS
7 type systems is by adding our repository!!! Please consult the
specific [Debian/Ubuntu](debian/README.md) or  [CentOS](centos/README.md). [Fedora](fedora/README.md) is also supported, but without an rpm repository

* For other systems, please either
 * Use the instructions for
 [pre-configured source code](src/README.md)
 * Build directly from the repo [build instructions](https://github.com/McStasMcXtrace/McCode/wiki/Building-McStas-McXtrace)
 * You are welcome to contact us in case of issues, e.g. via [mcstas-users](mailto:mcstas-users@mcstas.org)
